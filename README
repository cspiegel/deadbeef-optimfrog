This is an OptimFROG plugin for the Deadbeef media player.

To build, the OptimFROG SDK (http://www.losslessaudio.org/SDK.php) is
required.  Only version 1.500 (corresponding to OptimFROG 5.003) and
later are supported.  In addition, for vendors who create separate
development versions of packages, the development version of deadbeef
is required; this will likely be called something like deadbeef-dev or
deadbeef-devel.

GNU make is required, as is a C++ compiler that supports C++11.  Recent
versions of GCC and Clang are both supported.  Other C++11 compilers
should work, too, but may require the tweaking of compiler.mk.

Once dependencies are installed, build as follows:

$ make

This also assumes that Deadbeef is installed in /usr.  To specify a
different location, specify it with PREFIX:

$ make PREFIX=/usr/local

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Deadbeef's input plugin directory; as
above, if Deadbeef is not in /usr, PREFIX can be used to select its
location.  To install to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install DESTDIR=/path/to/staging
